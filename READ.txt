MY NAME IS GARUGU VEERA VENKATA SRINIVAS KALYAN. I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED MY WEB-TECHNOLOGY COURSE AND CREATED MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL FRONT-END WEBSITE CALLED "BY-IT".

NOTE: THIS WEBSITE IS NOT RESPONSIVE

PROJECT EXPLANATION
THIS PROJECT REALLY HELPED ME TO BRING THE CREATIVITY OF MAKING WEBSITES. I HAVE USED HTML, CSS AND SOME JAVA SCRIPT TO MAKE THIS WEBSITE. THIS PROJECT IS JUST A FRONT-END WEBSITE OF AN E-COMMERCE STORE WHICH SELLS ALMOST ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS.

HOW I NAMED MY WEBSITE?
THINKING A LOT OF TIME, I DECIDED TO NAME THIS WEBSITE "BY-IT". I REALLY FELT THAT NAME IS UNIQUE, AS WHEN WE SPEAK IT OUT, IT SOUNDS "BUY-IT"; WHICH IS REALLY GREAT AND UNIQUE. 
MY EFFORTS
I FELT THAT THIS COURSE SOLELY CANNOT DO MAGICS IN MAKING WEBSITES. SO, I DECIDED TO MAKE EXTRA EFFORTS TOWARS IT BY LEARNING NEW CONCEPTS DAY TO DAY. I REALLY FELT HAPPY WITH MY EFFORTS AS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE SLIDERS, BANNER AND SOME COOL STUFF. I ALSO MADE MY OWN LOGO, BANNERS, FLEXES TO MAKE THIS WEBSITE MORE FANTASTIC.
SOURCES FOR IMAGES

I USED CANVAS FOR MAKING LOGO AND GIF BANNERS. THIS WEBSITE IS REALLY HANDY IN QUICK CREATING THE LOGO AND BANNERS.

I USED PHOTOSHOP FOR SOME IMAGES AS WELL.

I USED PEXELS FOR GRABBING RAW IMAGES FOR MY PROJECT.

HOSTING SITE
I HOSTED THIS WEBSITE USING GIT HUB, LINK : 

OUTCOMES
I LEARNT WEB TECHNOLOGY VERY WELL AND I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS COURSE.
